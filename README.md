- Merge

1. Before merging into main: make sure your local Main branch is upp to date with the latest by doing a: `git pull` from your local Main branch.

Steps:
```
git checkout main
git pull orgin main
````

2. Go back to your working branch then do a git merge main and solve conflicts

Steps:
`git checkout` -your local branch name-
`git merge main`

    - solve any conflicts and test the website to make sure it works properly. Then commit any changes you made, then push.

`git commit -m "come up with a explaining message"`
`git push origing` -your local branch name-

3. When all conflicts are solved and everything is pushed, head back to Main branch to merge your working branch into Main branch.

Steps:
```
git checkout main
git merge -your local branch name-
git push origin main
```

4. Test the website and make sure it is working properly. Done!


TLDR: Fix conflicts on your local working branch BEFORE merging into Main branch. By doing so, hopefully it will result in less headache. =)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
